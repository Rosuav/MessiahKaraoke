Com-fort ye, com-fort- ye- My peo--ple,
Com------fort ye, com-fort ye My peo--ple,
saith your God, saith your God.
Speak ye com-fort-a-bly to----- Je-ru-sa-lem,
speak ye com-fort-a-bly to----- Je-ru-sa-lem,
and cry un--to- her, that her war---fare,
her war---fare is ac-com--plish'd,
that her in-i-qui-ty is par-don'd,
that her in-i-qui-ty- is- par-------don'd,

The voice of him that crieth in the wil-der-ness,
"Pre-pare ye the way of the- Lord,
make straight in the des-ert
a high-way for our God."-
