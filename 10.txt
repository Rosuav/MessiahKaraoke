For be-hold, dark-ness shall cov-er the earth,
and gross dark-ness the peo-ple,
and gross dark-ness the peo-ple:
but the Lord shall a-rise-{14<} up-on thee,
and His glo-{16}--ry shall be seen up-on thee,
and His glo--------ry shall be seen up-on thee.
And the Gen-tiles shall come to thy light,
and kings to the bright-ness of thy ri-sing.
