Thus saith the Lord,
the Lord of Hosts;
yet once, a lit-tle while,
and I will shake-{7}---------
the heav'ns, and the earth,
the sea and the dry land;
and I will shake-{12}-
and I will shake-{14}-
all na-tions;
I'll shake the heav'ns,
the earth, the sea,
the dry land, all na-tions, I'll shake,
and the de-sire-{21}---------
of all na-tions shall come.

The Lord, whom ye seek,
shall sud-den-ly come to His tem-ple,
ev'n the mes-sen-ger of the cov-en-ant,
whom ye de-light in:
be-hold, He shall come, saith the Lord of Hosts.
